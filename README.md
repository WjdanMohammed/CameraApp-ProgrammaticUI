## CameraApp-ProgrammaticUI
Hey there! This is a simple Camera Application that ***I and Sahab Alharbi*** worked on as part of Tuwaiq's iOS bootcamp projects. 

This app is meant to access the user's Camera and take a picture , then present it. 

The App was built ***Programmatically*** without Storyboard.

### This App Consists Of :
- An Animated Launch Screen.
- A simple login screen.
- A personalized home screen that **presents** the photo that was taken. a button that navigates to the Camera View for the user to **take photos**, and another button that will be visiable after the photo has been taken, that **saves the photo** to the user's Camera Roll.
